# AGIA1

This repository contains codes for forward and adjoint modelling of glacial isostatic adjustment. Programs contained in gia1d are model simulations in 1D viscosity models, but with the ability to compute sensitivity kernels for 3D viscosity perturbations [[1]](#1).
Programs in sl3d exent the method to allow for 3D viscosity models using a pseudospectral method developed by [[2]](#2). These codes were originally developed by Ophelia Crawford and David Al-Attar, and have been subsequently extended during as part of the 
grant NE/V010433/1:NSFGEO-NERC: Adjoint tomography of mantle viscosity using deglacial sea level observations.
